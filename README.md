# Book Search Engine

## Description
This is a project to refactor a working book search site scanning Google Books from RESTFUL APIs to GraphQL. New code included the GraphQL suite of typeDefs/resolvers and queries/mutations, with additional refactoring of existing code to perform CRUD operations using GraphQL methodology, including the fetch call to the Google Books site.
